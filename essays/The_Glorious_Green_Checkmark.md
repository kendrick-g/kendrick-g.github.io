  So far, ESlint has been a wonderful aid in coding. It definitely keeps the code clean and concise so that it works properly. I had code where it was multi-line and ESLint was like <i>Bro, just make it one single line</i>. ESlint is a wonderful tool; it can fix any error it deems as an error. The errors can stem from being an aesthetic error like having an extra space in your code to something major such as a missing semi-colon, a missing curly brace, or having an unused variable. To me, Coding Standards is a good basis to have. It shapes the fundamentals that you build off of and progress the more you learn and code. Coding standards can definitely help people learn a program language. At first, I was thinking <i> How would it do that?</i> Then it hit me; Coding Standards is a structure that helps you create readable code that anyone will be able to read. Consistency with coding standards ensures that you stumble upon less and less bugs in your code as well as maintaining your code over time if any changes are neceessary to be made.

  The green checkmark is very useful to see because it's basically like a thumbs-up that your code is good so far and ESLint doesn't see any errors. It's a good way to stay motivated to try and maintain that green checkmark from start to finish. Of course, we're all gonna stumble upon a few red warnings here and there and that is okay.To me, it's kind of like therapy to clear my code of any red errors and end up with that green check mark.

  All in all, coding standards is a wonderful thing. It's got the word "standards" in it for a reason meaning it's something that should be common amongst other people in the coding world. Everyones code will look vastly different, I'm sure. As long as the code is readable and concise, hopefully anyone would be able to make sense of your code and use it if need be. Having a checker like ESLint is amazing to have because it can give us peace of mind that our code is good if it shows a green check mark and it'll let us know of any errors. Of course, good ol' paranoia will still hit us in the back of our minds and we'll triple check to ensure our code works even with the green check mark. At least with the green check mark, we're on the right track. The only thing I feel ESLint will give a false positive green checkmark for is logic errors, which I feel only we have the power to catch because computers aren't the smart ones, we are...right? Maybe one day, someone will enhance ESLint to inquire whether we intend for one thing to happen vs another instance of something happening.
