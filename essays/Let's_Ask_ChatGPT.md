### I. Introduction
AI can play a major role in education by being able to display helpful information in anything that we are trying to learn about. I've only used ChatGPT to aid me in coding and it made the learning experience very interesting. It was very useful to use when you know what outcome you want but, are unable to get the process started. This is where giving it good prompts kick in. If you were to give a vague prompt, you wouldn't get the same output as a well written prompt. AI tools are only as capable as the user. 

### II. Personal Experience with AI:
I have used AI in class this semester in the following areas:

  1. Experience WODs e.g. E18: I have not used AI for any of the Experience WODS because of the WOD video demonstrations already available. The experience WODS were a chance to just try it out for yourself so, I never felt the pressure to use AI; I naturally yearned to learn and fail the Expereince WOD if need be and to watch the demonstration videos for what I did wrong.

  2. In-class Practice WODs: I have not used AI for the in-class practice WODS because it was an opportunity to learn without having to reference ChatGPT as much. I didn't feel any pressure from failing the In-Class Practice WODs and that greatly eased the urge to have to use ChatGPT to get the code to work correctly.

  3. In-class WODs: I most definitely used ChatGPT for the In-class WODs. For the very first In-Class WOD, I tried to do it without the use of ChatGPT. I ended up failing and it really gave me anxiety of even passing the class anymore. I decided to use ChatGPT for the rest of the In-class WODs. I would make sure I gave straightforward prompts to the AI by just copy pasting important criteria from each WOD and what end results were the goal. It felt like it would be a waste of time if the code produced by ChatGPT was not ideally working but, it felt super fast when it did produce great results. 

  4. Essays: I did not use ChatGPT to write my essays because it did not seem beneficial to use a script written by AI. I like to express my voice and way of writing so, I wrote my essays by myself. I think it shows your creativity because everything you write down is your own thoughts and ideas.

  5. Final project: I have definitely used ChatGPT for the Final project. Particularly, I inquired how to create a website that holds a list of clubs from another real website that contained the list of clubs. I used ChatGPT to aid my group for the Final Project as much as possible. I don't have much skills to offer when it comes to coding; so the least I can do is use AI tools to supplement where I lack.

  6. Learning a concept / tutorial: No, I don't use ChatGPT or AI tools when learning a concept or tutorial. The point of the tutorial is to already teach you the concept. The only way I can see the use of AI is if the tutorial is not sufficient enough for people to learn from. 

  7. Answering a question in class or in Discord : I haven't used AI when answering questions in class or on discord. I don't think I've actually answered any questions at all. If I were to though, I would make sure that what I say will be helpful and factual so that it doesn't cause more harm than good. I have good intentions to help but, if my information is not verifiable and accurate, then it doesn't matter how much I want to help because the results will not be so good.

  8. Asking or answering a smart-question: I did not use AI tools to ask or answer a smart-question because I feel people are capable of doing that themselves. When it came to answering smart-questions, it would be better to experience it first hand and replicate the issue and reverse engineer it to solve what was wrong. AI tools can only help so much but; nothing beats first-hand experience and knowledge from others that have already experienced it. Nothing beats that because then you'd lreaize that they overcame the issue and have a good, working answer that you don't have to wonder will work or not.

  9. Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”: Yes, I've used ChatGPT for coding examples. Particulary, I've prompted ChatGPT to show me how to use various functions from Underscore.js such as .map, .find, and .filter. ChatGPT was very handy when it came to showing examples of how to use specific code actions because rather than going through a manual, you have it displayed to you in real time through the use of AI.

  10. Explaining code: I found ChatGPT very useful to use when I wanted to learn about what some parts of code did in a program. I would use the prompt " What does this code do?" and paste a particular piece of code and then ChatGPT would give very informative results. I would verify if what chatGPT says is correct by following each line of code explained by ChatGPT.

  11. Writing code: Yes, I've used ChatGPT to write code for me. It made it very easy to just write prompts into ChatGPT and experiment with the resulting code and see if it gives the correct results. As long as the prompts are straightforward, the results obtained are usually correct. I found the use of AI to write code very helpful because I know what I want, I just don't really know where to begin for it. ChatGPT is like a translator that translates my gibberish into results that I want to happen like maybe creating a list of grocery store items in an array or how to create a class for a car and then create cars for that car class.

  12. Documenting code: I did not use ChatGPT to document my code. I don't think I even created comments throughout my code for people to use to understand what I write. Code comments would be very useful to use; I will make sure to add more documentation to my code in the future. I don't think it's necessary to create code documentation through the use of AI because at the time of creating the line of code, you should already know what it does at that point because that line of coded is being added into your program.

  13. Quality assurance: No, I haven't used ChatGPT for code quality assurance because then the errors would be explained if you just hovered over the underlined areas. The most I would do is do a google search if I wanted to learn more about the issue. Other than that, ESLint was very easy to use and I did not find using ChatGPT for quality assurance useful.
