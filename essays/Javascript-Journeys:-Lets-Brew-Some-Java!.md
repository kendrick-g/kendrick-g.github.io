  So far, Javascript has been amazing. It seems to be much more simple compared to Java. I'm still getting used to the syntax such as using "console.log" to print and display things or using "let" or "const" when it comes to creating variables.I absolutely adore the fact that you don't need to specify datatypes such as int or string when creating variables; especially using variables in parameters. This would be my first time using the Javascript language so I've definitely learned alot from the modules pertaining to Javascript and how it is used.From a software engineering perspective; I have no idea whatsoever if Javascript is a good or bad programming language. I feel any language can be good to use as long as it is readable. Now, when it comes to maybe efficieny in run times; then maybe Javascript could have an edge over another language such as Python or C#; I truly have no idea if that is true or not.

  I have never heard of athletic software engineering before but, I do find it interesting. It's basically a sport of the mind; maybe like chess but, with creating code for programs in a competative setting. I find the practice WODS very useful so far. I do enjoy "exercising" my mind to utilize critical thinking to create a code that makes sense from reading a prompt or situation like in the WOD. The idea of a time limit does put pressure on me though; which I think is a good thing. It really gets the gears of the mind going; It's probably a really good skill to have to be able to work under "fire", meaning under stress because its very possible that in the future you encounter multiple tasks to do at once. 

  I enjoy learning how to code because the feeling of when the code finally works is just unbeatable; it gives such a rush that I feel amazing. The journey to get there is not so bad either. I do enjoy challenigng myself and these WODS are a good challenge to take. I may not get the code right away but, I like that with practice, I'm slowly getting better and better at being creative and thinking how the code works and how to transform the prompt or situation from the WOD into actual code.Software engineering to me is very vast and mysterious. When I hear the words "Software Engineering"; I have this idea of multiple complex coding and structure. I hope that skills in coding languages such as Javascript will help me create a strong base so that I may use the skills towards a career in Cyber Security.So, literally from ground zero; here I am learning about Javascript and Software Engineering. Am I afraid? Yes, of course. Will I let that fear stop me? Of course not! Coding in itself is a skill that should be practiced just like how people would practice in a sport or video game to get better. I look forward to getting back up from any failures and take each day
