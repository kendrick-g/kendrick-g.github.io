  Starcraft2 has so many complex builds and paths to take that it all gets very overwhelming. Software Engineering is just the same if not more elaborate and intrinsic. There are so many branches to learn in the tree topic of Software Engineering. You can delve into database management, web development, security, or software architecture. There are many more but, the ones that I'm interested in are security, networking, and database management... maybe cloud computing and quality assurance testing as well. The basics of Software engineering gives people the necessary base to design, develop, maintain, test, and evaluate software and systems.<i>Why am I interested in Security?</i>Well, I just enjoy keeping things secure and safe from outside eyes that don't have a need to know basis on my information or the information of my future workplace. with Software Engineering, I'll be able to learn the design of security systems and delve into the areas of pen testing as well as learn algorithms that hackers potentially use to hack into a system. I feel networking goes hand in hand with security because if you aren't familiar with the network, how else are you supposed to protect it if you don't know your way around it?

  I hope to sharpen my critical thinking skills and think more creatively so that I can use it to become more proficient in coding. My long term goals are to learn and become proficient in automation so that I can automate specific tasks I've encountered in IT such as creating accounts for users or using active directory for particular things. My short term goals for Software Engineering is to just get a good grasp of the basics and from there build upon it. This is my first class learning about Software Engineering and I plan on making lots of mistakes unintentionally so that I may learn from them. I've heard about front-end and back-end software developers/software engineers and I realize that it's almost always a team-based environment. I love the idea of team-based because then it gives me a chance to collaborate with different people and pick their brains to learn new tips and tricks. 
  
  I have been exposed to the topic of Software Engineering; mainly through youtube where I'd watch videos about software developers/ software engineers working at google or amazon.From what I've seen so far; software engineers either have some downtime to patch up security and finish some side projects or things could be on fire (not literally) and the company website or an application could go down. I like how being a software engineer can be reactive as well as proactive. You react to whats happening around you and adapt. You try to be proactive and keep things updated so that things like getting hacked aren't a thing. It is very important to have a good basis and continue building on that basis; giving it a sound integral structure. I look forward to gaining experience in Software Engineering to strengthen my core knowledge of Software Engineering. I will learn from my mistakes and in order to increase my capacity to learn, I will always
