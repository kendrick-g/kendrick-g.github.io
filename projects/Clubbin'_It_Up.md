summary: "My teammates and I created a Club application that allows students to browse, join, and get updates for clubs at UH Manoa."

Our team is called "Club Meetup" and we were put in charge to develop an application which students can use to browse through clubs available at UH Manoa in a convenient fashion. The application would allow students to filter through the extensive list of clubs as well as get notified for any updates from the clubs they joined. Students would be able to comment any requests and opinions on how the application could be updated for improvement.

My contribution to this group project was to somehow get the list of clubs available on the UH Manoa Club website and create a website that contained the list of clubs. I also created a filter system on the club directory page that has a dropdown so students can easily browse through different category types of clubs. That way, they don't have to keep scrolling through each club one by one. I've also kept the Organization page for our project up to date; portraying our achievements and updates throughout the course of this project. It was really fun to create the Organization page because it felt nice being able to document the work we did.

I learned that teamwork is easier said than done. You aren't working with just one brain; now you have multiple sets of brains that all think differently. It's great to be able to split tasks to each member of the group so that we can all combine our skills in the end to come up with hopefully amazing results in terms of project completion. When it comes to team-based work, you have to ensure communication is consistent so that everyone is on the same page on what needs to be done and what has been done. This way, energy isn't wasted and the project can be kept moving forward slowly until it is complete. All in all, it was a fun project to do and it made me appreciate having team members moreso than I did before.
