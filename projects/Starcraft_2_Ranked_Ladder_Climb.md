This project was about achieving a high ranked position in the game of Starcraft 2. Starcraft 2 is a real-time strategy game where you can play against the A.I. or against real people. After each match I played, I would watch the match replay and carefully analyze many different things going on. I would like at the time stamps during gameplay to see where I could have been faster for a certain process. I would look at the opponents side and analyze what kind of units they would currently have at a specific time stamp of the match. The gameplay replays enabled me to take notes and determine where I can improve and also when the enemy is vulnerable.

Starcraft 2 is has 3 different playable races: Zerg, Protoss, and Terran. Each race has their own unique units with different strengths and abilities. There are also two types of units: light units and heavy units. The main race I played was Zerg. Zergs playstyle was a reactive kind of playstyle where you have to scout the enemy during a match and respond to what they are building. I would analyze each Zerg unit to learn in-depth about each of their abilities and how many of each unit do i minimally need to destroy the other player and win the match. This game was all about a combination of macromanagement and micromanagement. You have to build buildings which are then used to build units which each having their own build times. If a player is playing very efficiently; they can essentialy end the match within the 6 min mark and win the game. You can control your units as a group or as single-selected units; with good micromanagement, you can save units from being destroyed by an enemy units abilities or even outposition enemy units and attack them without getting attacked back.

Starcraft 2 has taught me important skills that I have built off of and maintained throughout my life. These skills include critical thinking, data analysis, time management, micromanagement, macromanagement, and learning from failure. It taught me to create an end goal as well as steps to reach that end goal. My end goal was to reach Diamond rank; I unfortunately reached Platinum only which was one step away from Diamond. Starcraft 2 was one of the best times of my life shared with friends that had the same mindset of getting in-depth with the details. I had to stop playing because I had joined the Air Force by then and didn't have the same time available as before at the time. I'm glad to have been able to experience such a game with amazing people.
